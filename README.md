<h2 align="center">Hello, नमस्ते! </h2>

<br />


Hi there, myself **Sanjiban Sengupta!**

I am currently a Doctoral Student at [CERN](https://home.cern/), affiliated to the [University of Manchester](https://manchester.ac.uk/) researching on optmization methods for efficient machine learning inference using heterogeneous architectures for the HL-LHC phase at CERN, funded by the [Next-Gen Triggers Project](https://nextgentriggers.web.cern.ch/).  

I have been involved with the TMVA team of [CERN's ROOT Data Analysis Project](https://root.cern/) since my acceptance in Google Summer of Code 2021. Thereafter, I participated in the CERN Summer Student Program 2022 in Geneva, Switzerland. Currently, I am an External User contributing to the development of SOFIE - The Fast Machine Learning Inference Engine, and co-supervising the Google Summer of Code and CERN Summer Student Projects of ROOT's TMVA.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer with the Data Engineering team at [Voltron Data](https://voltrondata.com/). My work involved enhancing open-source compute engines, data formats and relations specifications, that includes [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), [Substrait](https://substrait.io/), and [Velox by Meta](https://velox-lib.io/).
