Hi there, myself **Sanjiban Sengupta!**

I am currently working as a Software Engineer with the Data Engineering team at [Voltron Data](https://voltrondata.com/). My work involves enhancing open-source compute engines, data formats and relations specifications, that includes [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), [Substrait](https://substrait.io/), and [Velox by Meta](https://velox-lib.io/).

I am also involved with the TMVA team of [CERN's ROOT Data Analysis Project](https://root.cern/) since my acceptance in Google Summer of Code 2021. Thereafter, I participated in the CERN Summer Student Program 2022 in Geneva, Switzerland. Currently, I am an External User contributing to the development of SOFIE - The Fast Machine Learning Inference Engine, and co-supervising the Google Summer of Code and CERN Summer Student Projects of ROOT's TMVA.
